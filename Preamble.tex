The thesis “Improving Project Health using Machine Learning” by Pârțachi
Profir-Petru, the undersigned, is composed of three main papers which were
written in collaborations with others. For each paper, I include the list of
authors herein and detail exactly my contributions. All authors have contributed
significantly to the writing of the papers; therefore, I detail only non-writing
work herein.

\noindent\textbf{Aide-mémoire: Improving a Project’s Collective Memory via Pull
Request-Issue Links} 

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, David R. White, Earl T. Barr}

I have implemented the proposed PR-Issue linker, performed the exploratory data
analysis and feature engineering as well as wrote the evaluation and result
analysis scripts. The experimental and EDA designs were done in close
collaboration with David White who made sure I perform these correctly and
guided me patiently.

\noindent\textbf{Flexeme: Untangling Commits Using Lexical Flows}

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, Santanu Kumar Dash, Miltose
Allamanis, Earl T. Barr}

I have implemented in full the construction of our new structure, though the
idea of the structure was from Earl Barr, and the details of the specification
were worked in close collaboration. I also implemented the necessary methods to
construct the dataset, reproduced previous work in the area and implemented our
proposed untangling algorithms as well as their evaluation on the constructed
dataset. The RefiNym implementation was provided by Santanu Dash who helped me
integrate it with Flexeme. The original PDG extraction implementation for C\#
code was provided by Miltose Allamanis. Santanu Dash and I performed the manual
evaluations.

\noindent\textbf{POSIT: Simultaneously Tagging Natural and Programming
Languages} 

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, Santanu Kumar Dash, Christoph
Treude, Earl T. Barr}

I have implemented the preprocessing scripts, the Neural Network that realises
POSIT, the adaptation of the previous State-of-the-art to our problem, and the
necessary evaluation scripts. The Code Comments corpus was provided in by
Santanu Dash. The original implementation of TaskNav was provided by Christoph
Treude. Manual evaluation of POSIT was done together with Santanu Dash, while
manual evaluations of TaskNav augmented with POSIT were done together with
Christoph Treude.

\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
In recent years systems that would previously live on different platforms
have been integrated under a single umbrella. The proliferation of GitHub,
which offers pull-requests, issue tracking and version history, and its
integration with other solutions such as Gerrit, or Travis, as well as the
response from competitors has led to leaner and faster development cycles.
This has also reduced the cost of entry and created large, publicly
accessible sources of source-code together with related project artefacts.

This shift in tooling has also facilitated a shift in development paradigms,
developers now prefer a continuous integration/continuous delivery
infrastructure. This has led to more projects adopting a more agile
development process. Developers often forgo tasks that may aid project
health so that they can instead travel light. However, project health
determines project success.  Project health encompasses traceability,
documentation, adherence to coding conventions, in short tasks that allow
for lower maintenance costs and higher accountability.

Simultaneously, this shift has allowed for the proliferation of Natural
Language or Natural Language and Formal Language textual artefacts which are
programmatically accessible. This suggests that approaches from Natural
Language Processing and Machine Learning are now feasible and indeed
desirable. This thesis aims to (semi-)automate tasks for this new paradigm
and its attendant infrastructure by bringing to the foreground the relevant
NLP and ML techniques.

Under this umbrella, we focus on three synergistic tasks from this domain:
(1) improving the issue-pull-request traceability, which can aid existing
systems to automatically curate the issue backlog as pull-requests are
merged; (2) untangling commits in a version history, which can aid the
beforementioned traceability task as well as improve the usability of
determining a fault introducing commit, or cherry-picking via tools such as
git bisect; (3) mixed-text parsing, to allow better API mining and open new
avenues for project-specific code-recommendation tools.

\begin{impactstatement}
The work presented as part of this thesis opens the door to further research in
applications of machine learning towards aiding the process of software
development and making the profession more accessible. Directly, it helps
developers maintain projects in a state of lower technical debt and can, over
time, enable more sophisticated analysis by researchers as the quality of the
data improves. It also further paves the way towards multi-channel analysis of
coding artefacts where signal from both code and natural language are
considered. \todo{more stuff here about how this is impactful.}

\todo{Reduce repetitiveness}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Earl T. Barr for the sage advice and
importantly patience with me especially as I was navigating the landscape of
academic writing. I would also like to thank Earl for bearing with me as I fell
ill throughout the journey and offering support during those times. The
dialectic we had trying to formally prove a hypothesis with the clock ticking to
the deadline will be a fond memory for years despite the stress of the moment
then.

I would like to thank Dr David R. White for the `Desk Compensation Meetings'
that set me on the path towards rigorous experimental design early in my PhD and
that formed the support beams for my empirical studies throughout my doctoral
work. I would also like to thank David for being there for me when I needed
someone to listen to me and helping navigate the academic landscape with more
confidence.

I would like to thank Dr Santanu Dash, for helping me navigate the rougher sides
of Roslyn and enabling the work that followed from that. I would also like to
thank Santanu for helping me pursue an idea that later became a paper by helping
me with initial labelled data that would have been impossible without his CLANG
knowledge. The help and advice navigating formal languages helped shape my work.

I would like to thank my lab mates that made the journey more fun: Leo Jeoffe,
David Kelly, Bobby Bruce, DongGyun Han, Matheus Paix\~ao, Carlos Gavidia,
Giovani Guizzo, Vali Tawosi, Rebecca Mousa, Jie Zhang. The informal chats were
invaluable and they all helped me through the journey. Discussing our work
together helped me, and I hope them as well, better understand how to do proper
science, to better understand how and when statistical techniques should be
applied, how to formulate experiments, how to thoroughly explore hypothesises.

\pp{I would like to thank my family: my parents and my elder sister.}
