In recent years, systems that would previously live on different platforms have
been integrated under a single umbrella. The increased use of GitHub, which
offers pull-requests, issue tracking and version history, and its integration
with other solutions such as Gerrit, or Travis, as well as the response from
competitors creates development environments that favour agile methodologies by increasingly automating non-coding tasks: automated build systems, automated issue triaging \etc This in turn can favour leaner and faster development cycles. Further, by offering the automation as a service, the cost of entry for projects to make use of it has been reduced. In turn this has created large, publicly accessible sources of
source-code together with related project artefacts: GHTorrent and
similar datasets can now offer programmatic access to the whole of GitHub.

This shift in tooling has also facilitated a shift in development paradigms,
developers {now prefer} a continuous integration/continuous delivery
infrastructure. This has led to more projects adopting a more agile development
process. Developers often forgo tasks that may aid project health so that they
can instead travel light. However, project health determines project success.
Project health encompasses traceability, documentation, adherence to coding
conventions, in short tasks that allow for lower maintenance costs and higher
accountability.

Simultaneously, this shift has allowed the proliferation of Natural Language or
Natural Language and Formal Language textual artefacts that are
programmatically accessible. This suggests that approaches from Natural Language
Processing and Machine Learning are now feasible and indeed desirable. This
thesis aims to (semi-)automate tasks for this new paradigm and its attendant
infrastructure by bringing to the foreground the relevant NLP and ML techniques.

Under this umbrella, I focus on three synergistic tasks from this domain: (1)
improving the issue-pull-request traceability, which can aid existing systems to
automatically curate the issue backlog as pull-requests are merged; (2)
untangling commits in a version history, which can aid the beforementioned
traceability task as well as improve the usability of determining a fault
introducing commit, or cherry-picking via tools such as git bisect; (3)
mixed-text parsing, to allow better API mining and open new avenues for
project-specific code-recommendation tools.
