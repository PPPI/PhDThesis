\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

The software development process involves a multitude of aspects: the
specification and design, the architecture of the system, the code writing
itself, code version histories, issue tracking, code review. In an opensource
project: external collaboration and their integration. And last but not least,
the developers themselves and the project culture. Some projects are vibrant;
some moribund; others implode after a few commits. \emph{Project health}
determines project success. Project health encompasses: technical, traceability,
and social aspects of a project. It is defined by the quality of code,
documentation, version histories, issue tracking, specifications and
requirements. It is further defined by the quality of the interlinking of these
aspects. And last but not least, it is defined by the culture of the project, be
that explicitly codified in a file/manifesto or implicit in the interactions of
developers. In this work, I focus only on the first two aspects of project
health: technical and traceability. It is of no surprise that the artefacts
produced by these processes span a profusion of formats and both natural as well
as programming languages, even intermixed.

In recent years systems that would previously live on different platforms have
been integrated under a single umbrella, thus the different aspects that can
impact project health can be centrally observed. The proliferation of GitHub,
which offers pull-requests, issue tracking and version history, and its
integration with other solutions such as Gerrit, for Code Reviews, Travis, for
continuous integration and delivery, as well as the response from competitors
such as GitLab and Atlassian to offer equivalent offerings has led to leaner and
faster development cycles. This has also reduced the cost of entry and created
large, publicly accessible sources of source-code together with related project
artefacts. Within this context, developers can benefit from the automation of
tasks, especially if they are oft forgotten or ignored in favour of traveling
light. 

This shift in tooling has also facilitated a shift in development paradigms,
developers now prefer a continuous integration/continuous delivery
infrastructure. This has led to more projects adopting a more agile development
process. Cleland-Huang~\etal~\cite{Cleland-Huang2014} and St{\aa}hl
\etal~\cite{Stahl2017} observe that for traceability to be adopted within an
agile framework, it must remain within the traveling light paradigm.
Simultaneously, this shift has allowed for the proliferation of Natural Language
or Natural Language and Formal Language textual artefacts which are
programmatically accessible. This suggests that approaches from Natural Language
Processing and Machine Learning are now feasible and indeed desirable. This
thesis aims to (semi-)automate tasks for this new paradigm and its attendant
infrastructure by bringing to the foreground the relevant NLP and ML techniques.

\section{Problem Statements}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:problem_statement}

Under Improving Project Health, I focus on three synergistic tasks: (1)
improving the issue-pull-request traceability, which can aid existing systems to
automatically curate the issue backlog as pull-requests are merged; (2)
untangling commits in a version history, which can aid the beforementioned
traceability task as well as improve the usability of determining a fault
introducing commit, or cherry-picking via tools such as git bisect; (3)
mixed-text parsing, to allow better API mining and open new avenues for
project-specific code-recommendation tools. 

Software development is a community task. The programming task itself is a
component of a much wider process. It is, however, a task that is viewed
exclusively when considered by developers at the cost of other administrative
tasks. This manifests itself as, for example, in the case of traceability which
companies to recognise as important by organisations reaching an insufficient
level of traceability~\cite{mader2009motivation}. These administrative tasks
come with the promise of facilitating internal follow-ups, evaluation or
improvement of the development process~\cite{domges1998adapting}. Agile
practice, and especially Continuous Integration, by suggesting a lean approach
to documentation, reduces the direct applicability of existing approaches,
though work has been done to adapt to the new paradigm:
Ståhl~\etal~\cite{Stahl2017} provide the Eiffel framework, which allows
integrating different sources of traceability information in a light-weight
manner.

To help developers, tool-smiths themselves require supporting artefacts and
utilities. One of these is access to high quality data that can be used both to
train a human intuition for a task as well as statistical approaches to enable
developers from less well maintained projects improve their situation. The
proliferation of web-sites such as GitHub, BitBucket/JIRA, GitLab, and others
that enable developers to have commits, issues, pull-request, code-reviews and
other development processes under one umbrella also open a potential resource to
researchers and tool-smiths that wish to study the properties of the
inter-relationships of such artefacts. In this context, traceability can help
developers maintain the collective memory of projects. When using such
resources, developers are incentivised to maintain code-review/issue to commit
links by the promise of automatic triaging of issues as commits resolving them
are accepted into the mainline. I have, however, observed a lack of such links
as far as GitHub is concerned, despite an encouragement of contributors to do so
in the contribution guidelines. Further, developers only partially recording
such link introduces bias in the datasets researchers use.

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \emph{Pull-request-issue Traceability:} Given a project, developers should
    receive traceability link suggestions when pertinent, \ie when they are
    already performing a task within which a link can be recorded. For a
    pull-request-issue traceability, suggestions are to be made at issue triage
    and PR submission.
\end{tcolorbox}

Additionally, links may not be clear if the fixes are presented as unfocused
patches, hiding bug fixing beyond many lines of refactoring.
Herzig~\etal~\cite{Herzig2016} (Herzig and Zeller~\cite{Herzig2013}) show that
tangled commits introduce bias in defect prediction. In our work, I aim to
provide a diff time solution for commit untangling to help developers reduce
this bias. The promise to developers is enabling tooling such as git bisect.

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \emph{Commit Untangling:} Given a commit, the patch should be decomposed
    into smaller patches such that each patch tackles a single task, \ie would
    be linked to a single issue or implements a single stakeholder concern. On
    atomic commits, this process should be the identity function.
\end{tcolorbox}

Despite the international nature of platforms such as GitHub, a significant
portion of software development information is in English. This leads to
projects in other natural languages to adopt English terms within their
processes as observed by Treude~\etal~\cite{Treude2015portuguese}. Further, such
natural language can mix any natural languages it may use with formal languages.
This same phenomenon is observable on mailing lists, such as the Linux Kernel
Mailing List, and developer fora, such as StackOverflow.  Further, despite
access to mark-up to help developers demarcate code from English, in practice,
even on StackOverflow submitters do forget to do so. This reduces the applicable
research tools which use such formatting cues.

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \emph{Mixed-text Parsing:} Given an artefact that freely
    mixes natural languages and formal languages, separate the languages.
    Further, for each token, provide the tag in the language from which the
    token is taken. In natural languages, this tags are part-of-speech tags; in
    formal languages, these tags are the AST tags of the parents of the
    terminals.
\end{tcolorbox}

The tasks range from more developer focused to more researcher focused; however,
all tasks aim to, at worst, provide benefits to developers as a side-product if
not directly helping them.

Overall, the focus of this research focuses on the creation of tools and
meta-tools that (semi-)automate development tasks to enable project to remain
healthy. PR-issue traceability focuses directly on improving the development
process by reducing the administrative burden on the developers, while commit
untangling and mixed-text parsing focus on enabling a wider range of tools to be
applicable. The goal as a whole is an improvement of the development process by
allowing more time to be dedicated to the programming task rather than tasks
required to maintain the project health.

\section{Contributions}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:contrib}

Under the three synergistic tasks, I have found the following ways of improving
the state-of-the-art, which can benefit both practitioners as well as
researchers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This thesis provides an online pull-request traceability link
    inference algorithm realised as Aide-mémoire. It solves a modern variant of
    Bachman \etal’s ``Missing Links'' problem~\cite{MissingLinks} by departing
    from commits in favour of pull-requests. Aide-mémoire suggests links when
    developers are already handling a PR or an issue.
    \item This thesis forwards the state-of-the-art in commit
    untangling and thus enables the creation of better statistical tooling for
    developers indirectly, while directly allowing them to improve the health of
    their version histories. I realise this as a tool I call Flexeme. Flexeme
    offers precise untangling suggestions within 10 seconds, suggesting it could
    be integrated into the code review process.
    \item This thesis formulates the mixed-text parsing problem, posing it as a
    simultaneous segmentation and tagging task. It proposes a solution, POSIT,
    which borrows from the Natural Language Processing and Linguistics
    literature that concerns itself with code-switching. It maps the borrowed
    results to the Software Engineering context and allows extending methods to
    languages other than English or resources that freely mix natural and formal
    languages.
\end{enumerate}

The solutions I propose can help developers directly, by improving the state of
the project artefacts, or indirectly by helping tool-smiths. Further, these
solutions interact synergistically, the Flexeme and POSIT improve the quality of
the training data for Aide-mémoire, while also improving the general health of
developer version histories (Flexeme) or developer issue trackers and fora
(POSIT).

\section{List of Papers}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:papers}

\todo{Check with Earl that this is fine, otherwise, a we/I substitution might be needed}

A long research project, like a PhD, is a close collaboration where it is
difficult, often impossible, to separate each collaborator's contributions. What
is clear is who took the lead on which aspects and tasks. The reader will also
notice a mixed use of `I' and `we', I continue to use `we' in the paper chapters
when referring to work done in close collaboration with my co-authors as to
acknowledge their contribution. Further, the papers are presented as published
or submitted for review spare figures and tables that required editing to fit
into the thesis format. I now enumerate the tasks I lead on each of the papers
included in this thesis.

\noindent\textbf{1. Aide-mémoire: Improving a Project’s Collective Memory via Pull
Request-Issue Links} 

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, David R. White, Earl T. Barr}

\noindent\emph{Venue: Under submission to ACM Transactions on Software
Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)}

\noindent I have determined and mined the dataset of GitHub projects. I have
implemented the proposed PR-Issue linker, performed the exploratory data
analysis and feature engineering as well as wrote the evaluation and result
analysis scripts. The experimental and EDA designs were done in close
collaboration with David White who made sure I perform these correctly and
guided me patiently.

\noindent\textbf{2. Flexeme: Untangling Commits Using Lexical Flows}

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, Santanu Kumar Dash, Miltose
Allamanis, Earl T. Barr}

\noindent\emph{Venue: Proceedings of 28th ACM Joint European Software
Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,
(ESEC/FSE 2020)}

\noindent  I have implemented in full the construction of our new structure,
though the idea of the structure was from Earl Barr, and the details of the
specification were worked in close collaboration. I also implemented the
necessary methods to construct the dataset, reproduced previous work in the area
and implemented our proposed untangling algorithms as well as their evaluation
on the constructed dataset. The RefiNym implementation was provided by Santanu
Dash who helped me integrate it with Flexeme. The original PDG extraction
implementation for C\# code was provided by Miltose Allamanis. Santanu Dash and
I performed the manual evaluations.

\noindent\textbf{3. POSIT: Simultaneously Tagging Natural and Programming
Languages} 

\noindent\emph{Authors: Profir-Petru Pârțachi, Santanu Kumar Dash, Christoph
Treude, Earl T. Barr}

\noindent\emph{Venue: Proceedings of 42nd International Conference on Software
Engineering (ICSE ’20)}

\noindent I have implemented the preprocessing scripts, the Neural Network that
realises POSIT, the adaptation of the previous state-of-the-art to our problem,
and the necessary evaluation scripts. The Code Comments corpus was provided by
Santanu Dash. The original implementation of TaskNav was provided by Christoph
Treude. The informal proof of context-sensitivity of mixed-text was worked on in
close collaboration with Earl Barr without whom the proof would have not been
finished in a timely manner. Manual evaluation of POSIT was done together with
Santanu Dash, while manual evaluations of TaskNav augmented with POSIT were done
together with Christoph Treude.

\section{Thesis Organisation}
\label{chapter:introduction:sec:organisation}

\todo{Lazy enum or drop this section}
\Cref{chapter:literature} presents the relevant literature. It starts from a
general perspective on the constituents of project health and narrows to the
sub-problems tackled.

\Cref{chapter:am} presents Aide-mémoire, a solution to online pull-request-issue
linking problem. It extends the ``Missing Links'' problem due to
Bachmann~\etal~\cite{MissingLinks} to pull-requests and proposes a solution that
can live along side the code-review process. Aide-mémoire is evaluated on an
extensive corpus of GitHub projects.

\Cref{chapter:flexeme} presents Flexeme, a solution to the commit untangling
problem. It shows that Flexeme improves the state-of-the-art while being fast
enough to be viable at diff time. Flexeme is evaluated on an artificial corpus
that is rigorously constructed to mimic tangled commits
Herzig~\etal~\cite{Herzig2016} have observed developers make.

\Cref{chapter:posit} presents POSIT, where the mixed-text parsing problem is
introduced together with our proposed solution: POSIT. In it, we argue that the
mixed-text parsing problem is context-sensitive in the general case and hence
propose a neural approach for the problem. We show that POSIT can both directly
improve software fora by suggesting mixed code annotations, as well as aid other
research tools: we show POSIT to improve
TaskNav's~\cite{Treude:2015:TTN:2819009.2819128} recall.

\Cref{chapter:conclusions} concludes the thesis and provides directions for
future work.
